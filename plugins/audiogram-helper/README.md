# Audiogram Helper (local MCP)

This development adapter accepts one YouTube video URL, queues the existing Audiograms CLI in a detached local worker, and reports verified MP4 drafts under `out/treatments/`. It does not publish or upload clips. The job ledger lives in the ignored `.local/audiogram-helper-jobs.sqlite` file.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer (the local ledger uses Node's built-in SQLite module)
- Install repository dependencies with `npm ci`
- The existing Audiograms prerequisites for fetching and rendering: `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg, and ffprobe
- OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel available in your ChatGPT Developer Mode environment

## Start and connect

1. From the Audiograms repository root, run `npm run audiogram:mcp`.
2. Confirm the terminal reports `http://127.0.0.1:7331/mcp`. The process binds only to loopback; do not change the bind address or expose the port publicly.
3. In ChatGPT, enable Developer Mode and add a custom MCP app using the Secure MCP Tunnel workflow. Select this local service at `http://127.0.0.1:7331/mcp` as the tunnel target, then finish the connection in the developer UI.
4. In ChatGPT, submit one public YouTube video URL. The `create_audiogram` tool returns a job ID; call `get_audiogram_status` with that ID until it is terminal. Completed results contain repository-relative local artifact paths, not public download links.

The Secure MCP Tunnel is a private development bridge, not hosting. The tunnel configuration and credentials remain in the user/account environment and are not stored by this project. A service restart preserves recorded job outcomes; a worker that disappears before recording its result is reported as failed. A future cloud deployment would replace the local runner and artifact store while retaining the MCP contract; it is not configured here.

## Tools

- `create_audiogram({ url })`: validate the supported YouTube URL, create or reuse an active local job for that video, and return its opaque job ID.
- `get_audiogram_status({ jobId })`: return status and, only after verification, local artifact paths.
